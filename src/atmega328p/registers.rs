/// Bit 0 - Interrupt Vector Change Enable
/// The IVCE bit must be written to logic one to enable change of the IVSEL bit.
/// IVCE is cleared by hardware four cycles after it is written or when IVSEL is written.
/// Setting the IVCE bit will disable interrupts, as explained in the IVSEL description above.
const IVCE: usize = 0x00;
/// Bit 1 - Interrupt Vector Select
/// When the IVSEL bit is cleared (zero), the interrupt vectors are placed at the start of the flash memory.
/// When this bit is set (one), the interrupt vectors are moved to the beginning of the boot loader section of the flash.
/// The actual address of the start of the boot flash section is determined by the BOOTSZ fuses.
///
/// To avoid unintentional changes of interrupt vector tables,
/// a special write procedure must be followed to change the IVSEL bit:
///     a. Write the interrupt vector change enable (IVCE) bit to one.
///     b. Within four cycles, write the desired value to IVSEL while writing a zero to IVCE.
///
/// Interrupts will automatically be disabled while this sequence is executed.
/// Interrupts are disabled in the cycle IVCE is set,
/// and they remain disabled until after the instruction following the write to IVSEL.
/// If IVSEL is not written, interrupts remain disabled for four cycles.
/// The I-bit in the status register is unaffected by the automatic disabling.
const IVSEL: usize = 0x01;
/// Bit 4 - Pull-up Disable
/// When this bit is written to one, the pull-ups in the I/O ports are disabled
/// even if the DDxn and PORTxn registers are configured to enable the pull-ups ({DDxn, PORTxn} = 0b01).

/// Bit 5 - BOD Sleep Enable
/// BODSE enables setting of BODS control bit, as explained in BODS bit description.
/// BOD disable is controlled by a timed sequence.
const BODSE: usize = 0x05;
/// Bit 6 - BOD Sleep
/// The BODS bit must be written to logic one in order to turn off BOD during sleep.
/// Writing to the BODS bit is controlled by a timed sequence and an enable bit, BODSE in MCUCR.
/// To disable BOD in relevant sleep modes, both BODS and BODSE must first be set to one.
/// Then, to set the BODS bit, BODS must be set to one and BODSE must be set to zero within four clock cycles.
///
/// The BODS bit is active three clock cycles after it is set.
/// A sleep instruction must be executed while BODS is active in order to turn off the BOD for the actual sleep mode.
/// The BODS bit is automatically cleared after three clock cycles.
